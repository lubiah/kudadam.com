excerpt: Python has a count method to find the number of times an item appears in an array. Learn how to accomplish this in JavaScript, as it does not have that method.

If you have a Python background, you are probably familiar with the `count` method in the list class.
The `count` method does not exist in JavaScript. For those unfamiliar with the `count` method, it counts the number of times an item appears in an array. For example, suppose we have a `numbers` array, and we want to find the number of times the number '2' appears in the array. In Python, we would do it like this.

```python
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,2,4,2]
print(numbers.count(2)) # => 4
```

The code would return 4 because the number '2' appears four times in the array.
Since this technique did not exist in JavaScript, I decided to write my own.

```javascript
Array.prototype.count = function (item) {
	return this.filter((x) => x === item).length;
};
```

:::note{type=warning}
Extending JavaScript inbuilt classes can cause unexpected behaviour and conflicts with other libraries, so it's better to create custom classes instead.
:::

In the code above, I extended the Array class and added a new method called count through the prototype. The method takes an argument called `item`. It then filters the array and returns the number of times `item` was found in the array.

To utilise the code, simply construct an array and call the count method as shown below.

```javascript
let names = ['David', 'Walsh', 'David', 'Tania', 'Lucretius'];
names.count('David'); //=> 2
```
